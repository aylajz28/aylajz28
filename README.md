ABOUT ME <3

🌸 Hi there! I'm a 21-year-old student from Barcelona, currently studying Networked Computer Systems Administration!

💻 I'm very interested in cybersecurity- I love the idea of protecting systems, uncovering vulnerabilities...

⭐ When I'm not deeply focused on my homework, you'll probably find me sleeping, drinking coffee or trying to find cheap flights aroud the world ;P

🦋 I created this account to share my progress and projects with you all, so feel free to have a look around :)

🫶🏻 My goal? To become a confident cybersecurity professional specialized in ethical hacking!!!

❤️Thanks for reading!
